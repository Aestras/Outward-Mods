# Outward-Mods
 
Highly recommended to use with [BepInEx-Partiality-Wrapper](https://github.com/sinaioutlander/BepInEx-Partiality-Wrapper).

 * Some mods may require [SideLoader](https://github.com/sinaioutlander/Outward-Sideloader/blob/master/README.md)
 
 To download an individual mod:
 - In the mod folder, go into the 'Release' folder
 - Click on the .zip file
 - You can download the zip directly from the file page
 - For mods with no Release.zip, download the DLL file directly and just use that.
 
 To install a mod:
 - Put the zip in the Outward installation folder
 - Unzip it
 - If there is no Release.zip, put the DLL in Outward\BepInEx\plugins\
