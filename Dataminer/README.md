# Outward-Dataminer
 Mod which dumps prefabs and scenes in Outward to json files, and sorts the data.

Only the 2 .dll files are required if you want to run it, the rest of the files is the C# source and Vis Studio project.

* Dataminer.dll goes in Outward\Mods\ (or the BepInEx plugins folder)

* OModAPI.dll goes in Outward\Outward_Data\Managed\
