## Explorer

This is a debugging tool for inspecting the Outward game in a similar way to the Unity editor.

This mod <b>requires</b> BepInEx, it's not a Partiality mod.

Download the Explorer.zip file, place it in the Outward installation folder, and choose "Extract here". This will add the Explorer folder to Outward\BepInEx\plugins\, which contains `Explorer.dll` and `mcs.dll` (used for the console).

## Credits

Uses a light-weight version of the REPL Console from [Runtime Unity Editor](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/RuntimeUnityEditor).

Also includes the same `mcs.dll` from the one used in that repository.
