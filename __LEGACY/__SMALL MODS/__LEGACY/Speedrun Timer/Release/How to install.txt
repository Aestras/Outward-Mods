======== Using the Timer =======

Stop Conditions:

- Currently the timer supports two stop conditions: Well-Earned Rest, and Blood Price.
- You can cycle through the stop conditions with a keybind, by default it is F10.
- The timer will automatically stop itself when the condition is met.

Changing the keybindings:

- Edit the "Outward/Mods/SpeedrunTimer.json" file in any text editor
- https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html
- Pick any key name from the "Properties" section

How to Use / Notes:

- These keybindings work from anywhere in the game.
- You need to press the Start key to begin the run. It will start ticking when gameplay begins.
- You can press the Stop key to end the timer. It could be the same key you use to stop LiveSplit, etc.
- The timer will no longer reset when you go to menu. You can press Start or Stop to reset.
